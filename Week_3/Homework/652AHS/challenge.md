# 652AHS

## Description

I read that hashing algorithms are irreversible, so I hashed my password and forgot it, can you recover it for me ?

(Put the password in the flag format gomycode{...})

## Hint

- Get an idea of the encoded method from the title.
- Remember what do we do with this kinda crypto encoding.

## Files

- [hash.txt](challenge/hash.txt)
